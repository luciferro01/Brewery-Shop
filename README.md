Welcome to the Coffee Shop App! This project showcases a mobile application built using **React Native** with **Expo** and **Zustand** for state management. The app provides users with an intuitive and seamless experience for browsing, selecting, and purchasing various types of coffee from a coffee shop.

## Features

- **Home Screen**: Displays featured coffees, promotions, and categories.
- **Coffee List**: A searchable and filterable list of available coffee options.
- **Coffee Details**: Detailed information about each coffee including images, descriptions, and prices.
- **Cart**: Add coffees to a cart, view cart items, and proceed to checkout.
- **Checkout**: Collect payment details and shipping information.
- **User Profile**: Manage user information and order history.
- **Search & Filters**: Search for specific coffees and filter by category, price, or ratings.

## Tech Stack

- **React Native with Expo**: For building and running the cross-platform mobile application.
- **Zustand**: For managing global state in a simple and scalable way.
- **React Navigation**: For navigating between screens.
- **Styled Components**: For styling components (React Native’s built-in StyleSheet).

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
